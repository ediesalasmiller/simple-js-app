Project description:

- Simple app in JavaScript displaying a index of 150 pokemon from an external api: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150

- Created modals in bootstrap, displaying the name, height, and immage of each pokemon seperately.
- only an index main page with modals popping up upon selection. 
-ES2015
-functioning search bar, code outside of API, to run function upon clicking the search button.
-most CSS is from bootstrap, however I have overwritten some of it.
-added polyfills to provide the modern functionality to older browsers that do not natively support them.
